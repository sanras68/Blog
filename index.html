      <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than
        the
        majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller coaster
        and throughout it's run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer
        finality.
        This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action style of the
        previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and subverts expectations.

        The film's storytelling is some of the best ever seen in blockbuster filmaking, combining smart writing,
        intimate
        character moments, and exceptional world building to create one of the best blockbuster stories ever. The
        superheroes are all brilliantly acted and well written, with Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johannson, and Chris
        Evans
        in particular turning in some of the most human and enduring acting preformances I have ever seen. In addition,
        Josh Brolin once again proves utterly breathtaking as Thanos, and he somehow feels even more intimidating and
        horribly insane than he was in Infinity War. Further proving that Thanos is definitely among the very best movie
        villains of the last century.

        The action is honestly some of the finest in the history of cinema. The world renowned final battle of this film
        is riveting, heartbreaking, awe inspiring, and exceptionally well choreographed. Never before have I been so
        thoroughly moved and elated while watching a battle scene in film. The film's soundtrack is also one of the best
        of it's kind and brilliantly complements the action. It is filled with some of the most stunning, blood pumping,
        and epic music themes you will EVER hear.

        And while the time travel elements (as with all time travel movies) are certainly questionable, as long as you
        don't spend a week thinking about them they most likely will not bother you. This is my favorite movie of all
        time
        (yes I do watch other movies too) and I don't think anything will ever top the experience of watching this movie
        opening night in the theatre. However even upon second viewings the film remains an utter blast to watch with
        tons
        of replay value due to the many eastereggs to previous films. Smart, beautiful, epic, and timeless this is a
        superhero masterpiece!</p>

      <p>This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this
        either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is
        superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the
        stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African
        chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that.
        The best song is "Can you feel the Love Tonight?" but the others go without fault, "Circle of Life" is so spirit
        rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and
        Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the
        majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The
        vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best
        Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as
        well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV
        sequels.10/10. </p>
